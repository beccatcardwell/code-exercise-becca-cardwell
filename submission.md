## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

I made some a11y improvements:

1. The h2 elements had a very low contrast ratio of 2.98, which fails AA WCAG 2.1 levels. I changed the text color to black which brings the contrast up to 7.04, which passes AA and AAA for both normal and large text.
2. The headings levels skipped straight to h2. Skipping heading levels can cause confusion, especially for screen reader users that are navigating content by headings. I added an h1 before both h2 elements to pass.
3. The Exercise 2 dropdown menu design also had very low contrast, so I made the text color black

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?
